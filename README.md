How to run scripts.

First of all, make sure that you have installed nodejs.
Type in terminal: node -v or node --version
if the nodejs is already installed, its version will be printed in the terminal.
If not, type in terminal: sudo apt install nodejs.
After the installation is complete, you can run scripts directly in the terminal.

Open the directory with scripts in the terminal and type: node <file_name>
